# Intro

A small django project that produces a webpage that will show the latest issues
on a github repo.

The project uses caching to avoid repeated requests to the github api, ajax
queries to load additional issues (also cached) and can view any public repo on
github.

## Setup

git clone http://github.com/Laceysam/github_info.git
